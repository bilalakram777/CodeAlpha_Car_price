Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning is a short project that demonstrates how to build and evaluate regression models that estimate the selling price of used cars based on attributes such as brand, year of manufacture, present price, kilometres driven, fuel type, transmission type, ownership history, and seller type. Using Python with Pandas and NumPy for data handling, Scikit‑learn for model implementation, and Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualisation, the workflow covers data cleaning, label encoding of categorical features, model training with Linear Regression and Random Forest, metric‑based evaluation, and visual analysis through distribution plots, scatter plots of actual versus predicted prices, feature‑importance bar charts, and correlation heatmaps. The resulting models illustrate real‑world applications such as automated valuation for online resale platforms, dynamic pricing tools for dealerships, and decision support for individual buyers and sellers. To reproduce the work, clone the repository, install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt, load the dataset from a trusted source, and run the accompanying notebook or script.
Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict the selling price of used cars based on features such as brand, horsepower, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. It demonstrates a real-world regression problem and explores the application of models like Linear Regression and Random Forest.

                                                 ** Project Objective**

To build a regression model that accurately predicts car prices using key attributes from the dataset. This helps buyers and sellers make informed pricing decisions in the used car market.
